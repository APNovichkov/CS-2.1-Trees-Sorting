## Iterative Sorting Algorithms

### Topics
- Algorithm to check if items in a list are in sorted order
- Counting how many [inversions] there are in a list
- Classic iterative [sorting algorithms]: [bubble sort], [selection sort], [insertion sort]

### Resources
- Play with VisuAlgo's [interactive sorting visualizations][VisuAlgo sorting] including bubble, selection, and insertion sort
- Play with USF's [interactive sorting animations][USF sorting] including bubble, selection, insertion, and Shell sort
- Read Vaidehi Joshi's articles: [an overview of sorting][BaseCS sorting], [bubble sort][BaseCS bubble sort], [selection sort][BaseCS selection sort], and [insertion sort][BaseCS insertion sort] with beautiful drawings and excellent analysis
- Watch Zutopedia's [insertion sort vs bubble sort robot video]
- Watch Harvard's [bubble sort video], [selection sort video], and [insertion sort video]
- Watch HackerRank's [bubble sort tutorial video] (*spoiler alert:* contains solution code)
- Watch Toptal's [sorting animations] to see how algorithms compare based on input and read the discussion section
- Watch dancers perform [bubble sort with Hungarian folk dance], [selection sort with Gypsy folk dance], and [insertion sort with Romanian folk dance]
- Watch videos to observe patterns: [9 sorting algorithms], [15 sorting algorithms], [23 sorting algorithms]
- Read Interview Cake's [triangular series article] for more background on counting inversions and pairs
