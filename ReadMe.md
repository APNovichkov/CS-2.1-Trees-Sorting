# CS 2.1: Advanced Trees & Sorting Algorithms

## Course Description

In this course students will implement and test advanced data structures and algorithms, benchmark performance, analyze algorithmic complexity, explore trade offs in performance and memory usage, and draw out elegant problem-solving techniques. Key concepts include sorting algorithms, divide-and-conquer recursion, heaps, tries, self-balancing trees, and execution trees. Students will build an original project that applies these data structures to real-world problems such as autocomplete, family trees, and board games. Students will also write technical articles about these topics to deepen their understanding and create their online presence as knowledgeable and proficient software engineers.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:
-   implement and compare several sorting algorithms and know when to use which ones
-   apply divide-and-conquer recursion techniques to elegantly solve complex problems
-   analyze complexity of recursive algorithms with recurrence relations and master theorem
-   implement abstract data types including priority queues, binary heaps, and tries
-   implement self-balancing tree structures including AVL trees, splay trees, and 2-3 trees
-   implement tree traversal algorithms: depth-first and breadth-first ordering
-   utilize bit manipulation algorithms to store and access information in individual bits


## Evaluation

To pass this course, students must meet the following requirements:
